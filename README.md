# web-prototype

Prototypes for new website components in React.

## Build

Uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16 and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) version 8. (You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install both and conveniently switch between node versions.) Then run the following as needed:

```shell
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server with hot reloading 
npm start

# Build development package
npm run build
```
